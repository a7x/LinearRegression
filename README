This is a simple implementation of Linear Regression with single and multiple variables in Python. I have deliberately avoided the use of NumPy and SciPy libraries.  Hence,  tasks like  summing up  arrays , standard deviation , means are all done  via code from the ground up . 

The dataset used is the one  provided for the 1st assignment of ML-class of  fall '12, stanford  ( The free online one ) .  The explanation of the code, procedure and  related things can be found at http://rohitdholakia.com/blog
