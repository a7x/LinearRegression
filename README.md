#Linear Regression

This is a simple implementation of Linear Regression with single and multiple variables in Python. I have deliberately avoided the use of NumPy and SciPy libraries.  Hence,  tasks like  summing up  arrays, standard deviation, means are all implemented from scratch. 

The dataset used is the one  provided for the 1st assignment of ML-class of  fall '12, Stanford (CS229).
